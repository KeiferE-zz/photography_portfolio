# photography_portfolio
A website portfolio built from scratch to display my photography work. 

### Why am I using Webpack for a static site? ###

Good question, basically I want to able to easily manage and build my files required for the site. Although right now all that is planned is a static site to display a portfolio it may build into something more. Other reasons are to minimize HTTP requests, minify my code, and learning to better use webpack.
